## Search (Subsystem of AIMA Code)

[comment]: # (Changed by: Peter Norvig, 30-Oct-1996)

The <b>search</b> subsystem contains code from part II on problem
solving, search, and game-playing.  The main data type is the
<tt>problem</tt>.  each new type of problem needs a representation for
states, a successor function, and a goal test.  You can find examples
of this in the <b>domains</b> subdirectory.
