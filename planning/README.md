## Planning (Subsystem of AIMA Code)

[comment]: # (Changed by: Peter Norvig, 30-Oct-1996)

The <b>planning</b> subsystem will cover the code in Part IV of the
book.  So far we have not developed any code.  However, there is a
very good system called <A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/www/ucpop.html">UCPOP</A>
available from the University of Washington.  Much of the presentation
in the book follows UCPOP and its predecessors and successors, so it
should be easy to understand.

<p>Eventually, we plan to provide our own simplified versions of
several planners here, and show how to hook them up to the wumpus and
shopping environments.<P>
